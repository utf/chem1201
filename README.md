CHEM1201: Organic Chemistry
===========================

My notes for the CHEM1201 Organic Chemistry module at University College London.

*DISCLAIMER: These are latex versions of my handwritten notes and really arenot useful for learning purposes, instead for me, they serve for as a useful reminder and revision tool. You have been warned!*

About
-----

I'm a third year Natural Science student at Univeristy College London and this christmas I decided that it'd be worth writing up my first and second year organic chem notes in latex for revision purposes.

This isn't supposed to be a comprehensive collection of notes and I can guarantee that I've made some mistakes copying it up. It may however prove to be useful to somebody so thats why I'm developing them on here.

Technical Stuff
---------------

It's all written in latex and its mostly simple stuff. The diagrams were drawn using ChemDraw and the eps's have been provided if you want to make any changes/use them for yourself.

I've been adhering to my own, concocted style guide in terms of both latex code and rendered output. A couple of things worth noting are the custom commands I've written to ease including diagrams these include ```\img{...}``` and ```\imginline{}```.

For chemical figures, they should be drawn using a modified *ACS Document 1996.cds* template, with both atom labels and labels set to use size 9 Helvetica.

Thats it I think... I'd love to hear from you if you find this useful!
