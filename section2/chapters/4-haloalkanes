\section{Alkyl Halides (Haloalkanes)}

The chemistry of halogens is dominated by the nature of the halogen bond. Due to
the electronegativity of the halogens, bond polarisation occurs through inductive
effects \ce{H3C^{$\delta$+}-X^{$\delta$-}}. This means that the carbon is
electropositive or electrophilic and therefore reactions involving heterolysis
of the \ce{C-X} bond will lead to \ce{X-}. THis group, X, is termed the leaving
group.

Within the halides the relative abilities to function
