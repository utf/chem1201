\section{Alkenes}

\subsection{General}

General formula: C\sub{n}H\sub{2n}

Ethene has a planar framework of atoms

\img{2-1}

Tye carbon atoms have 3 sp\super{3} hybrid atom orbitals using the 2s and only 2
of the 2p orbitals) which lie in the xy plane orientated at 120\de\ relative to
each other. The \ce{C-H} $\sigma$ bonds are formed by overlap of the sp\super{2}
hybrids on carbon and the 1s on hydrogen, the \ce{C-C} $\sigma$ bond is then
constructed using the remaining sp\super{2} orbitals. The weaker $\pi$ bond
is constructed using sideways overlap of the reaming 2pz on each carbon atom.

\img{2-2}

The chemistry of alkenes is dominated by the ability of the 2$\pi$ electrons to
donate themselves, i.e. function as a nucleophile. Geometrical isomerism occurs
due to restricted rotation about the \ce{C=C}. The Z isomer is when the larger
products are on the same side (cis) and E is when they are on opposite sides
(trans).

\subsection{Reactions of Alkenes}

Due to the ability of the $\pi$ cloud to donate 2 electrons, electrophilic addition
to alkenes is a wide ranging and general series of reactions. For a reagent of the
form \ce{E^{$\delta$+}-Y^{$\delta$-}} the following mechanism can be written.

\img{2-3}

First the there is complex formation with the polarization and lengthening of the
\ce{E-Y} bond followed by the formation of the \ce{C-E} bond and breakage of
the \ce{E-Y} bond. Finally nucleophilic capture occurs with the reactive carbocation
intermediate.

Some useful reagents are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \ce{Br2}
  \item \ce{H-Cl}, \ce{H-Br}. \ce{H-X} etc.
  \item \ce{H3O} - acid
  \item \ce{Br-OH} - hypobromous acid (or from fromation of borohydrin via
    \ce{H2O}/\ce{Br2})
  \item \ce{Ph-S^{$\delta$+}-Cl^{$\delta$}-} - sulfenylation
\end{itemize}

Electrophilic additions to unsymmetrical alkenes are regiospecific (only one
regioisomer formed). This method of addition was first noted in 1870 by Markovnikov
and is stated as an empirical rule -- markovnikov's rule. This is because
addition always occurs via the lower energy carbocation.

E.g.

\img{2-4}

When the component E of the reagent \ce{E^{$\delta$+}-Y^{$\delta$-}} posseses lone
pairs of electrons, reactions are also sterospecific (only one sterioisomer formed).

E.g. Addition of bromine to Z and E-but-2-ene.

\img{2-5}

The opening of the bromonium cation occurs by nucleophilic attack from the least
hindered opposite face (antiperiplanar position). Overall the reaction is a trans
(or anti) electrophilic addition. Similarly the reaction of E-but-2-ene gives a
different diasteroisomer.

Other examples of bridged intermediates that form stereospecific compounds are:

\img{2-6}

Some reactions are both regio and stereospecific. E.g. BrOH

\img{2-7}

Bromohydrins are used in the preparation of epoxides. E.g.

\img{2-8}

Hydration can also occur via acetomercuration to form an alcohol (see section 1)
and either \ce{NaBH4} or NaOH can be used as bases to remove the final \ce{Hg-OAc}.

\subsubsection{Reactions of Carbocations}

Carbocations undergo 3 types of reaction:

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]

  \item Capture by a nucleophile
    \img{2-9}

  \item Proton loss to give an alkene
    \img{2-10}

  \item Carbocation Rearrangement
    Rearrangement will always occur to give a lower energy carbocation. Examples
    of rearrangement during electrophilic addition to an alkene are:

    \begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*)]

      \item Wagner--Meerwein rearrangement involving a 1,2-Alkyl shift

        \img{2-11}

        Mechanism

        \img{2-12}

      \item Hydride Shift

        \img{2-14}

        Mechanism

        \img{2-15}

        The 1,2 alkyl shift would give the same 2\de\ carbocation and therefore
        would not be lower in energy.
    \end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Other Alkene Reactions}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]

  \item Hydroboration (followed by oxidation) - useful for anti-markovnikov
    hydration.

    \img{2-17}

    Mechanism

    \img{2-18}

    Is electron deficient but commercially available as a complex with the ether
    THF.

    \img{2-19}

    This takes place in a syn addition in a concerted way (both bonds are made
    in the same step). The bond to B is made slightly faster since it is the
    electrophilic center and the electron deficient atom. This results in the
    observed regiochemistry.

    Each of the remaining \ce{B-H} bonds also adds across an alkene to give

    \img{2-21}

    The carbon--boron bond is then replaced by a hydroxyl group with retention
    of configuration.

    \img[The final step occurs via borate ester hydrolysis]{2-22}

    The proof of the hydroboration mechanism can be shown using deuterium labelling

    \img{2-23}

  \item Vicinal cis dihydroxylation

    \img{2-24}

    Mechanism via a concerted cycloaddition reaction.

    \img[Osmate ester formed]{2-25}

    Both the oxygen atoms are delivered from the same side (i.e. syn addition).

    Similarly for \ce{K+MnO4-} under basic conditions using the ion

    \img{2-26-1}

    WIth excess \ce{KMnO4} over oxidation can occur.

    \img{2-26}

    and in general for acyclic alkenes

    \img{2-27}

  \item Ozonlysis of alkenes

    This is a milder method for oxidative cleavage of \ce{C=C} than \ce{KMnO4}

    \img{2-28}

    Common reducing agents are:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item \ce{Me2S} - Dimethyl sulfoxide
      \item \ce{Ph3P} - Triphenylphosphine
      \item \ce{Zn/H3CCO2H} - Zinc/acetic acid
    \end{itemize}

    Mechanism:

    a) Formation of ozone electrophile

    \img{2-29}

    b) Concerted cycloaddition

    \img{2-30}

    c) Fragmentation

    \img[Carbonyl oxide intermediate]{2-31}

    d) Recombination via a second cycloaddition

    \img{2-32}

    e) Reductive workup (e.g. \ce{Ph3P})

    \img{2-33}

  \item Preparation of epoxides using a peracid

    This reaction preserves sterochemistry and preserves alkene geometry, it is
    stereospecific. The oxygen is delivered from the least hindered side - steric
    approach control.

    \img{2-34}

    Mechanism

    \img{2-35}

    Epoxides are useful synthetic intermediates as they undergo ring opening
    reactions with nucleophiles and can easily be stored unlike bromium cations.

    Example 1. Ring opening under acidic conditions with \ce{H2O} as a nucleophile

    \img{2-36}

    Example 2. Amines used as nucleophiles

    \img{2-37}

    Many other nucleophiles can be used including:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item \ce{RO-Na+}
      \item \ce{RS-Na+}
      \item \ce{R-} from RMgI
    \end{itemize}

  \item Catalytic hydrogenation - Synthetic route to alkanes

    \img{2-38}

    Typical metal catalysts are Pd, Pt, Ni and both hydrogen atoms are always
    delivered to the same side of the alkene.

  \item Addition of hydrogen bromide in the presence of peroxides

    This is a free radical chain reaction that gives the anti-markovnikov product.
